# **Accessing Reddit from Indonesia**

Indonesia is one of the [few countries that blocked reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/ot8ysz/legal_status_of_reddit_worldwide/). So, you need to use an alternative DNS, modified host file, or VPN to access Reddit in Indonesia. It'll be best to set up your phone/computer before entering the country.
